# Job-Satisfaction-Survey
Leaving your job is never easy. It took me 6+ months to put my thought of quitting into action. 
This self-survey is designed to assist you in making a prompt and informed decision on whether you should leave your current job.
I built this form after a week of self-study on freeCodeCamp's web design course.![Job Satisfaction Self-Survey Output](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24996005/216870583-2b81e80c-cf12-4f6c-9979-245fd4be8ca6.png)
